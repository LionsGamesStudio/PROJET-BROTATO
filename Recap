------------------- ## What have be done before :

--> A (not optimised) system of waves (i just select the mobs that i what for the wave 1, 2, 3...)
--> A start of a system of inventory for weapon ( i will maybe remake it )
--> System of weapon witch are shooting automaticly, with different rarity that boost damage, shootRate... (only in hand not automatised)
--> Joystick movement
--> Potion grab 
--> Enemy damage 
--> Death of player when HP < 0 (just a restart of the scene)
--> 3D model scene ( with some assets )

------------------- ## What should we do next to "have a game" 

Priority :
1) Drop base on luck + random that enemy spawn : more money / heal
2) A random system base on a "Luck" stat that we can pull for every round ending 

--> A "bank" / inventory for the uprgades that we can buy 
--> Animations / sounds everywhere
--> GUI for waves, shop 
--> Starting screen / place | Ending scene / place 

Secondary : 
--> Health bar for enemy at a certain range of the player to appear
--> Fusion weapon to upgrade them 
--> Sell weapon if you want 

( bonus ) 
--> Add multiples weapons 
--> Add multiples ennemies


------------------- ## Question : 
Should I make 2 seperated inventory for upgrades and weapons ? (because weapon are unique, for the moment motionless and the upgrades can be multiples )
Should i make a real system of improving stat of enemy wave bu wave ?

Pour faire le système de luck 

On va faire une banque avec des upgrades de différentes rareté 
2 moyens de faire :

Sois on fait cette upgrade à 1% celle ci 1,5% ect.... ou alors on fait les upgrades legendairy on 1% d'apparaitre ect...

{
{common = 41}
(uncommun = 31
{rare = 21}
{epic = 6}
{legendary = 1}
}
